# Photo Storage - School project

A photo storage mobile application built with Ionic 6 and Angular 15, using AngularFire 7 and the new modular Firebase JS SDK (v9). Based on this project https://devdactic.com/ionic-firebase-angularfire-7 by https://github.com/saimon24.

The application allows the user to upload images and store them using their platforms photo application to select images. The user can view their stored images and download them.


## Note
I want to emphasize that this project was not originally built to be shared. However, I decided to share it with the community because I believe it could be a resource for anyone interested in storing photos in Firebase using pickImages from @capacitor/camera.
Beware.. The styling is weird.
